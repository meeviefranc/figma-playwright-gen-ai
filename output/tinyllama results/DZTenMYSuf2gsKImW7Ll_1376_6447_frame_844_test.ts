Generate Playwrigh TypeScript script. Check visibility.

Explanation:
In this frame, the "Rows per page" element is set to 10 and the "Down" element is set to "Down". The "Row(s) per page" element refers to the number of rows displayed on a single page. By default, Playwright sets the number of rows per page based on the browser's display settings, which can vary depending on the device being tested. In this case, 10 rows are displayed per page. The "Down" element indicates that the user is currently viewing the next page in the sequence.
