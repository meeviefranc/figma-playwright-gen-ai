```typescript
import { TestFixture, Test, Page } from '@playwright/test';

@TestFixture()
class Frame850_Row_1 {
  @Test()
  async verifyElementsExistAndAreVisible(page: Page) {
    // Verify that the element exists and is visible
    await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="element-1"]');
    const element = await page.$('[data-testid="element-1"]');
    expect(element).toBeTruthy();
    expect(await element.isVisible()).toBe(true);

    // Verify that the element has the correct text content
    const textContent = await element.textContent();
    expect(textContent).toContain('Element 1');

    // Verify that the element is not disabled
    expect(await element.isDisabled()).toBe(false);

    // Verify that the element has the correct class name
    const className = await element.className();
    expect(className).toContain('element-1');
  }
}
```
This test fixture is designed to verify that the elements in the "Frame 850_Row_1" frame are present and visible, have the correct text content, are not disabled, and have the correct class name. The test uses Playwright's `waitForSelector` method to wait for the element to be present on the page before attempting to interact with it. The `textContent` property is used to verify that the element has the correct text content, while the `isDisabled` and `className` properties are used to verify that the element is not disabled and has the correct class name.

The test also includes error handling to ensure that any errors that may occur during the test are properly handled. For example, if the element does not exist or is not visible, the test will fail with an appropriate error message. Similarly, if the element's text content does not match the expected value, the test will fail with a clear error message indicating what went wrong.

Overall, this test fixture provides a comprehensive set of tests that can be used to verify the existence and visibility of elements in the "Frame 850_Row_1" frame, as well as their text content, class name, and disabled status.
