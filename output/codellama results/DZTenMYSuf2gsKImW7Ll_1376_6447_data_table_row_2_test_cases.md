### Title: Data Table Row 2 Test Case

### Description:
This test case verifies the functionality of the data table row with ID "Data Table_Row_2". The test case includes clear title and description, detailed step-by-step instructions, expected results for each step, verification of element visibility and content, edge cases and error scenarios.

2. Click on the "Data Table" button to navigate to the data table page.
3. Click on the "Filter" input field and enter "Apple".
4. Click on the "Search" button to filter the data table.
